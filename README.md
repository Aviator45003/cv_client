# CVOS -- The Premier Honors Computing Experience

##Summary
CVOS is a a customize variant of Ubuntu, designed for the Collegium V Honors College.  By default, CVOS runs the Cinnamon desktop environment, providing a familiar interface for Windows users.  However, as is common with Linux distributions, advanced users can customize their session, choosing their own window manager and configuration.
CVOS comes with a variety of software packages, including web browsers, an office suite, image editing software, and much more.

##Why we use CVOS
For many years, the Collegium V Honors Lounge was home to a multiple operating systems.  Desktop computers ran Windows or Mac OSX, while servers ran OpenBSD or Linux.  As technology and the Collegium V lounge have evolved, it has become near impossible to manage the conglomeration of protocols and systems, many of which had partially broken or poorly documented implementations on Windows.  In order to continue improving the lounge's network, while keeping things set up securely and properly, it became necessarly to switch to a UNIX-based system.

In addition to enhancing security and simplicity, switching to CVOS has improved aspects in many areas.  For example, before the switch, reinstalling the OS of all the systems could take several days, but, with the automation CVOS allows, this now could take less than an hour.  

##Requesting additional software
In the event you would like software which is not installed on CVOS, don't hesitate to request it.  You can do this by creating a ticket in Github's issue tracker for the [collegiumv/cv_client_bleeding](https://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client_bleeding/issues) repository.  If possible, please provide a summary of the program's usefullness, a link to the software package, and a note of any special requirements or configurations.

If you have any issues, let a Collegium V Administrator know, and they will be happy to help
